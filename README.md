# Coffee-shop-management
Final C# Group Project
This project is an uncomplete group project.
Before I learn how to use Git, our group only send parts by Google drive. I sent my part to another PC, only one PC to show our lecturer, so now I only keep my part.
As you can see, this repo only shows my part, that why you can see many uncomplete functions.
