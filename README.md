# Coffee-shop-management
Final C# Group Project
This project is an uncomplete group project.
Although I update my work in GitHub, my team member only pulled to their local repo, updated their work in one PC and shown the project to our lecturer.
As you can see, this repo only shows my part, that why you can see many uncomplete functions.
